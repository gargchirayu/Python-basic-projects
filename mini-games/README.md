Here I have coded some basic games, as part of my ongoing practice in python that I undertook in my #100daysofcode challenge. These are a part of the basic projects as these are currently primitive in the sense of the 'computer player' and their interface.
I am hoping to move to GUI and ML soon, and will look forward to implement these in a much more interactive and challenging way.
