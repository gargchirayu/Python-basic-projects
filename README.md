# Python-basic-projects
Some basic python programs, did for practice and learning

This is one of the first few exercises I have taken up during my #100daysofcode journey. I learnt python some time back but never practised enough to be able to say I mastered it, so here I am starting with the very basics.
I'll be adding to this repository daily for the next few days, coding basic python programs, beginner-level stuff. Hope to do much more in the upcoming days.
